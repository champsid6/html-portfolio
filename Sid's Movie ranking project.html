<h1>The Best Movies According To Sid</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie because it has all the elements of a great movie, the acting is fabulous, the pace<br />
    is just superb and the ending is to die for</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorites because it was one of the first movies that broke norm, the structure of the movie<br />
    is just something I had never seen before yet it keeps me so captivated, the direction by Christopher Nolan is<br />
    brilliant, the perfomances by the cast is simply ten-on-ten and the background score is brilliant.</p>

<h3>City of Angels</h3>
<p>This movie simply is one of those movies for date night. Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage are just electrifying together,<br />
    the ending is a bit teary eyed but I can see this movie another 100 time. </p>
